# Buzzvel-UI-Reproduction

This repository contains the implementation of a Figma prototype provided by Buzzvel, reproduced using Next.js. The project is a part of a technical evaluation and showcases my front-end skills, particularly in responsive design and component architecture.

<strong>Overview<strong>

The project consists of a web-based homepage designed as a single-page application, broken down into multiple components. The main requirements include two versions of the homepage:

Web Version: A desktop homepage that includes a header, five sections, a container, and a footer.

Mobile Version: A mobile-responsive version of the same homepage, containing the same components in a different layout to improve user experience on smaller screens.
